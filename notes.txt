Rss feed is functioning perfectly off AWS RSS feed. 

1. Find more rss feed urls that work !!!

Got it limited to 3 items or so per feed and it seems that AWS, although listed second or last, still dominates the other urls
and positions itself first in the feed. interesting. 

2.  Schedule it so that it runs automatically on its own in the cloud.  Make the generated html post to a github repository. 
done!  I added it to the startup file on my windows os, avoiding cloud costs!  lol. 


3.  add a godaddy domain to this program so that it publishes to github and then publishes to godaddy. 
Adding wolfranktrading.com 
done! 

4.  See about adding a chart to the top of the feed, along with a streaming ticker, embed a nq futures chart, pivots, daily range etc. ! 

add a quanstat printout of returns on nq= f !!!!! 

find more working rss feeds. dailyforex didnt work. 

5.  make sure the project pushes to git etc. properly!  

6. work on css, add images, layout features and spacing, make the page more attractive.
